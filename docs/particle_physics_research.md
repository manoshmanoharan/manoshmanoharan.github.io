| The Profiled Feldman-Cousins technique for confidence interval construction in the presence of nuisance parameters|
| [ArXiv (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14353) **NOvA Collaboration**|
|:----------|
| **Abstract:** Measuring observables to constrain models using maximum-likelihood estimation is fundamental to many physics experiments. The Profiled Feldman-Cousins method described here is a potential solution to common challenges faced in constructing accurate confidence intervals: small datasets, bounded parameters, and the need to properly handle nuisance parameters. This method achieves more accurate frequentist coverage than other methods in use, and is generally applicable to the problem of parameter estimation in neutrino oscillations and similar measurements. We describe an implementation of this method in the context of the NOvA experiment. |



| Measurement of the $$\nu_e$$-Nucleus Charged-Current Double-Differential Cross Section at $$⟨E_\nu⟩$$= 2.4 GeV using NOvA|
| [ArXiv (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10585) **NOvA Collaboration**|
|:----------|
| **Abstract:** The inclusive electron neutrino charged-current cross section is measured in the NOvA near detector using $$8.02\times10^{20}$$ protons-on-target (POT) in the NuMI beam. The sample of GeV electron neutrino interactions is the largest analyzed to date and is limited by $$\approx$$ 17% systematic rather than the $$\approx$$ 7.4% statistical uncertainties. The double-differential cross section in final-state electron energy and angle is presented for the first time, together with the single-differential dependence on $$Q^2$$ (squared four-momentum transfer) and energy, in the range 1 GeV $$\le E_\nu<$$6 GeV. Detailed comparisons are made to the predictions of the GENIE, GiBUU, NEUT, and NuWro neutrino event generators. The data do not strongly favor a model over the others consistently across all three cross sections measured, though some models have especially good or poor agreement in the single differential cross section vs. $$Q^2$$.|
