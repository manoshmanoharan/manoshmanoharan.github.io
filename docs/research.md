# Research Publications


Mostly I work on problems in theoretical physics, however, I am interested in almost everything I read. For me there is nothing boring in this world (Except for the '*pay wall*' in some journal). In theoretical physics, I work mostly on problems in cosmology and particle physics. I have also worked in theoretical quantum optics and experimental high energy physics. My special focus is on dark energy models and neutrinos.

You can find the full list of my publications down here :

**Research trends vary across the globe. This is what the global search trend looks like for dark energy, neutrinos and cosmology.**
